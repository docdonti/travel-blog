Bali is an island off of indonesia known for it’s beautiful nature and scenery, serene beaches, never ending rice terraces and rich culture. The Balinese people are some of the most kind hearted and welcoming people I have ever met. Their lives are deeply rooted in their culture and religion as they carry on their sacred traditions even today. They not only have a strong sense of community amongst one another, but also have a oneness with nature. The great thing about vacationing in Bali is that there is something for everyone. Whether you are craving that adrenaline rush swinging hundreds of feet over the palm trees, hoping to reconnect with yourself and your surroundings through meditation and yoga, or spend the days watching beautiful sunsets over the beaches and partying the night away, Bali has something for everyone. My husband and I visited in February of 2020 and had the time of our lives. Although the flight time was roughly 24-26 hours, it was worth it! Before taking any trip, I truly believe it is important to find out a little bit about where you will be visiting. Here are few key things to note:



Culture: Most Balinese people are Hindu while much of the population in Indonesia is actually Muslim. Family and strong sense of community with deep roots in religion are the pillars of the culture here. In Bali, numerous family members often live together in a multi-family home/community, sometimes upwards of 40 or 50 people. A home may look small from the outside but these can be vast properties that include their own rice fields, gardens, numerous animals, and other agriculture. Each home has a family temple. You will likely see many of these from the street. Families come together to celebrate holidays and festivals at their family temple. There are also public temples everywhere. It is important to wear asarong andselendang(sash)to show respect when entering a temple as a strict dress code is often enforced. Most public temples will provide you with the attire but dressing conservatively is encouraged. The balinese women make offerings daily called ‘Canang sari’ which you may see on the streets. The base is made out of a palm leaf and flower petals are placed on top. The traditional language spoken in Bali is Balinese, however most people we interacted spoke English pretty well.



Travel/Transport. Bali has one major airport called Nagauraih. From the airport, there are taxis available. Uber has been banned in most areas. There is another application called Grab, which is very similar to Uber. We used Grab for most of our trips. There are many taxis available, some good and some not so good. Blue Bird Taxi is a trusted company and recommended by most. You should always ask for the meter to be turned on, unless you wish to make a deal with the taxi driver instead. One thing to note is that the Ubud area has its own community of taxi drivers. The prices are usually a bit more steep. Blue Bird Taxis and other online taxis are generally not available. You can easily hire a private driver while in Bali for a very reasonable price, in the range of $30-50 per day. I recommend taking a few taxis to see who you get along with and seeing if they would offer a day tour package. Alternatively, you can hire a driver through trip Advisor, Klook or viator. This can be booked in advance before your trip, or even just a day or two before while on your trip. Most drivers use WhatsApp so it makes communication very easy. We decided to hire a driver on the days where we had full itinerary and lots of sight seeing on our agenda. Other days, we got around just fine with a taxi. Although Bali itself is not a huge island, the roads can be quite small and you should always take into account the traffic patterns/rush hour times. Most roads are local roads with a few highways here and there.

Food: Most families buy their fruits and vegetables at the local market if not grown inside their own homes and cook food daily. Balinese food can get quite spicy. Ingredients such as garlic, turmeric, chili and lemongrass are key players in most Balinese food. Apart from homemade meals, there are many restaurants in Bali, everything from traditional indonesion to easily available vegan/vegetarian options, as well mexican and italian restaurants. Some of the best vegan-vegetarian food I have ever had has been in Bali. Fresh coconuts are sold throughout the island and are a great way to stay hydrated. Fresh fruits, fruit juices, smoothies and smoothie bowls are in abundance here, so I highly recommend trying a few new things. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you. A local restaurant is called a Warung, and they mainly serve traditional Indonesian food. You will see numerous Warungs all throughout Bali. Many of the meals in Bali are actually served on a banana leaf. Restaurants usually have a service tax as well as a government tax. I would recommend drinking only bottled water, and avoiding any tap water.



Weather: Bali’s tropical monsoon climate has two seasons. Dry season takes place between May and September while wet season occurs from October to April.This by no means implies that there won't be heavy rains in the dry season or that you won't have beautiful bright clear skies in the wet season.The climate is typical of any tropical paradise. It is always hot, and absolutely impossible to predict when a thunderstorm may occur. There may be heavy storms that come on strong but only last 20-30 minutes, or it may rain all day. I suggest always carrying an umbrella. April to October usually means little rain, low humidity and lots of sun. One thing to keep in mind is that hotel prices, day to day traffic, lines for popular sightseeing spots,and crowds, are very much dependent on the time of year. We chose to travel in February, which was within the rainy season. We found that the mornings were typically free of rain and there were a few storms in the late afternoon. Fortunately for us, we faced no crowds, minimal crowds, and treated ourselves to luxury resorts that were much more affordable because we chose to go in the wet season. It's a gamble, but high risk high reward. Overall, we were extremely lucky as the rain did not interfere with our plans, but this was just our experience.



What to pack: Packing clothes really depends on what you are hoping to experience on your trip. A few nice bathing suits for the beach, shorts, skirts, or dresses for the hot weather, and possibly a few conservative pieces for visiting the temples. Hats and sunglasses are a must, as well as sunscreen. I would also recommend buying mosquito bands on Amazon (or wherever) to avoid those pesky mosquito bites. Oh, and ALWAYS bring an umbrella with you unless you enjoy soaking in the unpredictable rain. If you plan on shopping, pack light. Streetside vendors are more than willing to bargain so brush up on your negotiation skills and dont be shy. If you buy more than one item, you will usually also get a better deal. The nicer shops and boutiques are typically fixed price. Bamboo Blonde was one of my favorite shops and I was able to score cute dresses for reasonable prices.



Money: The currency used in Bali is known as rupiah. About 14,000 rupiah is equivalent to $1.00 USD. Although higher end boutiques/stores and restaurants accept credit cards (with a 3% fee), most roadside vendors, small shops and taxi drivers will use cash. The entrance fees to activities and temples typically also accept only cash.



Now that you know a little more about Bali, take a look at where we went and what we did to help plan your own travel itinerary!



Where we stayed:

There are so many areas to pick from for your stay in Bali, so I suggest doing your research to get a feel of what works best for you. When it comes to accommodation, the options are endless, from a private villa with your own pool, to a luxury hotel and spa nestled in the rice terraces, a beachfront resort, or even an airbnb or homestay. Bali is great for both budget-friendly as well as luxury travelers. The Ubud area is a popular choice for many tourists and is surrounded by beautiful rice terraces and traditional villages. The nature makes it a very serene and peaceful atmosphere. The city center has lots of markets, shopping, restaurants and temples. We chose not to stay in the center as we wanted a bit more peace and relaxation. Instead we stayed in the tegalalang area, which was a short 15-20 min car ride to Ubud center. We then moved down to the Nusa Dua area, known for its beautiful beaches. We ended our trip in Seminyak, another popular destination for tourists. Here we chose to stay smack dab in the middle of the city to have walking access to all of the shops and restaurants. There are many bars and clubs for those who enjoy the nightlife. Seminyak has been called the foodie capital of Bali and we had some of our best meals there!



Accomodations:

Ubud Area: Kuwarasan (highly recommend, one of my favorite)

SereS Spring Resort (pretty nice)

Nusa Dua: The Mulia Resort (5 star property, truly exceptional)

Seminyak: Stayed in an Airbnb



What we did:

We spent a good portion of our trip trying new restaurants, gawking at the breathtaking landscapes, taking part in yoga classes, enjoying our hotels and talking with the locals.

Tegalalang Rice Fields

Bali is surrounded by so many beautiful rice fields but one of the most iconic and well known are the Tegalalng rice fields. It's best to go in the morning time (before 8 or 9am) not only to avoid the tourist buses and crowds but also to take advantage of the cooler weather. As the day goes on, the hot sun can become quite exhausting. The lighting in the morning also tends to be better for pictures. I would recommend visiting on a day you choose to be more active. Not only are there numerous steps to climb up and down, the heat and humidity makes the walk along the paths a bit of a work out. Remember to bring lots of water, a hat, and sunglasses. Wear comfortable shoes that you would not mind getting dirty. Sandals are okay as long as they have good traction and support. You could get away with a cute skirt or dress but save the long flowy dresses and long skirts for another time. Your feet may get a bit muddy. There are a few different ways to enter the rice terraces. Numerous shops and restaurants line the terrace, so you could squeeze in between them and enter into the terrace. There is usually a man standing around with entrance tickets for a small fee of about 10k per person. We spent about 2 hours walking from one end to the other. When we made it to the other end, we stumbled upon Santana rice terraces. There was a little cafe with the most adorable old selling fresh coconuts and playing music. This may have been the most refreshing coconut of my life after a long walk in the sun. There are a few swings that are available here, however I didn’t partake as I went to Bali Swing on another day. Take lots of pictures and let your eyes feast on the beauty of the rice terraces. When you are finished, there are many cute restaurants and shops for you to enjoy. I have also heard great things about Jatiluwih Green Land terraces but we didn't have time for it this trip!



Balinese Cooking Class

This was the first time my husband and I took a cooking class, and we had an absolute blast. There are many classes you can book on tripadvisor, Airbnb, Klook, and viator but we chose to book tours through Cookley. Most morning classes include a trip to the local traditional market, so I would choose that over an afternoon class. Some take places in rice fields or hotels, but what I liked most about ours was that it took place in a traditional Balinese home. We booked the KDongDing cooking class and had an exceptional experience. It received high ratings/reviews and was mentioned on…(). I would highly recommend this class. Not only did we learn so much about various fruits and vegetables, but we also learned a lot about balinese culture and cooking. The small class size made for a more intimate experience and we got to keep the recipe book at the end. The food was mouth watering and the best part is that we made it ourselves (with a little help of course). Our instructor Nyomen had a lively personality and truly made the class. His family welcomed us into their home with no reservations at all. Many of the cooking classes, like ours, also had vegetarian/vegan menu options as well!



Bali Swing

The Bali Swing has made it's way all over instagram and has become a popular tourist attraction. If you’re an adrenaline junky and you like taking pictures hundreds of feet above ground, then this is for you. The $35 ticket price (I booked mine on Klook) includes unlimited access to 7 types of swings, a few cute birds nests, photo taking points (helicopter, sky bed, ship) and a lunch buffet (haven't heard the best reviews, I didn’t personally eat there). I had hired a driver for the day but there is apparently also a free shuttle bus near the Queens of India restaurant in Ubud, and certain online tickets also include pick up and drop off from you hotel for an additional fee (About 250,000 rupiah if coming from the Ubud area). Alternatively, you can take a taxi. I would suggest coming early in the morning (before 9am) to avoid the long wait times and ques. Again, the sun is also more forgiving at this time. Once you enter, you will be asked to sign a waiver At this time, you can also purchase a photography package (about $12) if you would like professional photos taken for you as you fly high in the sky. I chose this option as the quality of the pictures far exceeded the capability of my iphone. At the end you experience, they will airdrop all the photos onto your phone for you. There are lockers available as well if you need to store anything. When I went, there was also a little shop that rented out beautiful dresses for your time at the Bali swing (100k rupiah for a short dress, 200k rupiah for a medium length dress and 300k rupiah for a long flowy dress). I felt like I was wearing a 100 pounds of heavy silk in the hot scorching sun, and carrying around the dress from swing to swing was a bit of a circus act, but in the end, the pictures were breathtaking and truly worth it. Although there are risks associated with this activity, I felt quite safe in the harness. You will be positioned properly on the swing before they deliver that first push. I enjoyed soaring above the trees and taking in all of nature's beauty without any fear.



Spa Time

There is no shortage of spas in Bali from the most affordable to the most lavish. Balinese massage and holistic treatments are a wonderful way to escape the hot sun (or a rainy day) and indulge in some “Me time.” I had never heard of a flower bath before embarking on this trip, and let me tell you, it was one of the most unforgettable experiences. Not only is the entire bathtub filled with gorgeous flowers, but the aroma is a gift for the senses. I would highly recommend booking one at some point in your trip. We chose the Kaveri Spa at the Udhaya resort as they are known for their intricate flower designs guaranteed to make a statement on any instagram feed. Their service was excellent, starting and ending with a cup of tea. I had mentioned it was my birthday and they even brought out a plate of dessert for us to enjoy during our bath. I would recommend contacting them through Whatsapp (many spas allow this) in order to book in advance (a few weeks in advance). My husband and I also planned a spa day with 3 hour packages at the SereS Spring Resort (where we were staying). This included a massage, facial, body scrub and body mask. Most of the spas have various packages that you can select from and the prices are much cheaper than in the U.S. I suggest taking some time to research the various spas and options that are available. We did not try any roadside massages but I recommend doing your research as some of them did not appear to have the highest sanitary standards, etc. Whatever you decide, make sure you take some time out of your trip to try the various treatments and treat yourself to some well deserved relaxation.



Mount Batur/Lake Kintamani



Handara Gate

I’ll keep this post short and sweet. Handara gate is a well known gate in Bali that has also become a popular point for picture taking. It is actually the entrance to a golf resort but the beautiful backdrop of the mountain and the lush greenery makes for a scenic photo. Again, I recommend arriving early in the morning. Some suggest coming as early as sunrise but again, it depends on which time of the year you are going. There is a small entrance fee per person and a small parking lot. You will get a few minutes to take your picture before it is the next person’s turn in line. We were actually very excited to visit the Gates of heaven at Lemp… temple but there was a huge Holiday in Bali (gulugang) during our time in Ubud and the temple was closed. We thought we would settle for the Handara Gate, but when we arrived, it did not feel like settling at all!.



Uluwatu Temple and Kecak Dance

What can I say about the Uluwatu temple? This temple is considered to be one of Bali’s spiritual pillars and sits beautifully on top of a steep cliff. With the Indian Ocean as your backdrop and the sounds of the waves as they splash against the rocks, peace and serenity are within reach. The best time to visit is just before sunset, so that you may watch the colors of the sky change above the ocean. You must wear a sarong and sash, which will be provided with the entrance fee (about 100k rupiah per person). The temple shrine itself is a quick visit, and not very spectacular in my opinion. The grounds are vast and you can walk around, but there isn’t much to do. This famous sea temple is also known for the Kecak & Fire Dance, which takes place at the amphitheater. It begins at 6:00 pm every evening and costs about 150k rupiah per person. I would suggest arriving an hour or so before, buying tickets (if interested in seeing the dance) and then exploring the temple grounds. The performance starts with a group of men shaking their hands and chanting ‘chak’ ‘chak’ choruses repetitively. Warning, this goes on for the entire hour. I personally found it mentally draining. The dance however is a depiction of the Ramayana, a great Hindu epic which tells the story of Lord Rama and Goddess Sita. There are some entertaining theatrics involving fire as well. There is no public transport to and from Uluwatu so make sure to pre-arrange a ride or taxi. Also to keep in mind is that monkeys in the area are notorious for stealing sunglasses, phones, camera’s etc, so be aware of your personal belongings at all times!



Tukad Cepung Waterfalls/ Tibumanna Waterfalls

Bali is filled with so many beautiful waterfalls, and several are easily accessible from the Ubud area. When deciding which ones to visit, distance, the amount of effort needed to get to the waterfall itself, and type of experience you are hoping to have all play a role. For us, we wanted to visit a waterfall that was unique. We were willing to take on a bit of a challenge, but nothing too adventurous. The first waterfall we went to was called Tukad Cepung. The reason it was so spectacular was because it was located inside a cave, something I had never witnessed before. It is best to visit in the late morning or around noon, on a sunny day. The light beams are truly stunning. After reaching the parking lot, there is quite a trek to get to this beauty. There is a small fee to enter, and changing rooms are available. You will first make it down numerous steep stairs and then need to walk barefoot on some not so smooth rocks. With every step, I wanted to yell, but we made it through the rocky waters in 10-15 minutes. This waterfall is not really for swimming. The waters are shallow, and again, there are many rocks. The force of the waterfall was strong, but the water is so refreshing (would not recommend directly standing under the waterfall). There were many people trying to take solo instagram worthy photos, which didn’t allow everyone else to truly enjoy. All in all, this truly was a spectacular experience with lots of photo ops.



Next we continued on our journey to Tibumanna waterfalls. It was about a 40 minute drive from Tukad Cepung. After we parked, it was a short walk down the stairs to reach the falls. Not much effort needed at all. We then arrived at what appeared to be a large natural swimming pool and gorgeous waterfalls surrounded by lush greenery. It is easy to spend a few hours playing in the water, and maybe even having a picnic on the rocks. Again, do not stand directly under the waterfall, but you can swim up to it. There is a small entrance fee and changing rooms here as well. The atmosphere is serene and the waters are calm, perfect for a day of swimming.



Other Bali waterfalls (which we did not have time to explore):

Gitgit, Leke Leke,Tegenungan, Sing Sing, Kanto Lampo(during wet season), Nung Nung, Niagara Munduk,Sekumpul,Banyumala,Aling-Aling (slip and slide adventure)



Ubud Market

The Ubud market is situated in the city center, known for selling fruits, jewelry, hand made bags and purses, sarongs (amongst other articles of clothing), handicrafts and souvenirs. They are open from 9am-6pm. Because this area is famous for tourism, not everything is necessarily cheap. Remember to bargain for a fair price. You will usually find better deals in the morning time, before the crowds arrive. The surrounding streets of downtown Ubud (city center) have many restaurants, spas, boutiques and bars, as well as a few temples. The Ubud palace is also close by.



Cultural Show



Bali is an island of rich traditions. Various forms of Balinese dance, including the mesmerizing Lelong (royal court dance), lively Kecak (depicting a scene from the Ramayana epic), Barong & Kris (a dance drama depicting the eternal battle of good versus evil)and joged (a social dance), help to delve a little deeper into the culture itself. These shows take place throughout various cafes, parks. temples, and theaters. On any given night of the week, you can probably find a performance going on, especially in the Ubud area. Bali has numerous different dance troops. There will almost always be an entrance fee, as you are after all watching a performance. We chose to watch a Lelong show at the Ubud Palace. The ticket is 100k/person and the show usually starts at 7:30pm. They have a different show every night. Recommend arriving early for good seating. It was a beautiful performance but the movements do get a bit repetitive after some time. The costumes are stunning. The musicians play traditional instruments. I would say it is worth experiencing at least one show during your trip to immerse yourself in the performing arts.

Temple Run:

Pura Ulun Danu Bratan is Bali’s most picturesque temple, and trust me, I have been to a lot of temples in my life time. Surrounded by a gorgeous lake, the views of the Gunung Bratan mountain in the backdrop is a feast for your eyes. The cooling mist from the waters adds to the refreshing nature of this place. You can easily spend a few hours walking around the beautiful temple grounds, exploring, and taking pictures. There is even a little cafe that serves food and fresh coconut water, as well as an ice-cream shop. I recommend visiting on a day where you have clear visibility, and preferentially in the morning, before all the tourist buses arrive, in order to have as much of the peace and serenity to yourself. There is an entrance fee of 75k rupiah. It is about an hour and a half from Ubud, but only 15 minutes away from Handara Gate. I would definitely recommend hiring a driver for this one.



Pura Tirta Empul is another Hindu Balinese water temple located in the lush tropical forest of central Bali. Locals and tourists from all over to take part in the sacred purification ritual. If you wish to participate, you must be fully clothed, and wear a sarong and a sash. There is an entrance fee for the temple itself, and a seperate fee for cleansing in the holy spring water. There are roughly 30 water spouts. You will start on the left side, join the line, and await your turn. When it is your turn, you will dip your head underneath the spout and let the water run over you. This ritual is known as ‘melukat.’ You can next move on to the next line. If you plan on getting wet, it is best to explore the grounds first and save this for last. It takes about 30 minutes to an hour to walk through the entire temple complex. When you enter the actual temple portion, you may be asked to tie your hair up in a bun. There is also a lovely koi fish pond that is walled off from the rest of the complex (also has a little cafe). To avoid the large crowds, I recommend coming in the morning or late afternoon. Although the source of water is thought to be clean, I haven't truly researched it myself and would advise doing so (or just take the risk and live life!). As you exit the temple, a line of roadside shops and vendors will approach you to buy clothing, amongst other things. If you do give in, remember to bargain!
